The sortAlg.py is an application written in python for the purpose
of comparing the sort time of different algorithms. This program 
demonstrates a few different sorting algorithms. First you must
generate an n-sized array that will be given random numbers in
a random order. Then you can choose which sorting algorithm you want
to use:
-Bubble Sort
-Selection Sort
-Radix Sort
